## Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- JPA/Hibernate
- Postman for API testing

## API Endpoints
### 1. Create Weather Record
- **Method:** POST
- **URL:** `/api/weather/create`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
      "city": "CityName",
      "temperature": TemperatureValue,
      "weatherCondition": "sunny|cloudy|rainy|snowy"
  }
  ```

### 2. Get All Weather Records
- **Method:** GET

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run`.
4. Use Postman to test the API endpoints.

## Flowchart
Here's a flowchart to visualize the process of adding a weather record:

````artifact

      A[Start] --> B[User submits weather data];
      B --> C{Is data valid?};
      C -->|Yes| D[Add record to database];
      C -->|No| E[Return validation error];
      D --> F[Record added successfully];
      F --> G[End];
      E --> G;
````

## Conclusion
This Weather API application provides an easy way to manage weather records while enforcing validation rules to ensure data integrity. For any issues or feature requests, please open an issue in this repository.
